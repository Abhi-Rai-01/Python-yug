# Arithmetic Operators:-
# - used to perform arithmetic operations on two or more operands.
# Below are arithmetic operators:

#addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

print(2 + 3)
print(2.0 + 3)   #if any one of the two operands is float then the result will also be float
print(2 - 3)
print(2.1 - 3)   #if any one of the two operands is float then the result will also be float
print(2 * 3)
print(2 * 3.0)   #if any one of the two operands is float then the result will also be float
print(2 / 3)    #always returns float value only
