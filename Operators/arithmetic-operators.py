print(2 + 3)
print(2.0 + 3)   #if any one of the two operands is float then the result will also be float
print(2 - 3)
print(2.1 - 3)   #if any one of the two operands is float then the result will also be float
print(2 * 3)
print(2 * 3.0)   #if any one of the two operands is float then the result will also be float
print(2 / 3)    #always returns float value only

print("\t")
print("\t")
print("\t")
print("\t")

# using variables
num1 = 2
num2 = 3
print(num1 + num2)
